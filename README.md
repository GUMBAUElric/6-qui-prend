## About this project

This project takes up the idea of [6 qui prend !](https://www.gigamic.com/jeu/6-qui-prend) board game.

### Back

- Implements all the rules of the game.
- Wait, receives and processes player actions.
- Communicate with socket.
- Manage 1 game of 2 to 10 players.
- Use mutli-threading.
- Is written in C++.

### Front

- Sends player actions to the server.
- Receive the state of the game via sockets.
- Is written in Vue.js and uses electronjs.

## How to install

- Clone this git repo and place it anywhere on your pc

### Back

- Open a terminal, go to the folder 'back' and type

```bash
  make
  build/server 127.0.0.1 YOUR_PORT
```

> 'make' use the g++ compiler to compile all the files. The compiled file is in build folder.

> 'build/server' start the socket server with the ip and port you specified

If you see the following line on the terminal

```text
  [SOCKET] === SERVER STARTED ===
```

that mean that all the is ok !

Well done !

### Front

- Open a terminal, go to the folder 'front' and type

```bash
  npm i --legacy-peer-deps
  npm run electron:serve
```

> 'npm i' install node modules.

> 'npm run electron:serve' start a electron app.

Follow the instructions.

Enjoy ! ðŸ˜‰

## Why we choose electronjs

We chose electronjs because we have more ease with the javascript language compared to C# and WPF does not exist on a linux OS.
We could not set up a docker image because there is a lot of incompatibility with electronjs.
